            Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)
            is a story-driven role playing game, which is often played in a group with pen and paper.
            D&D players often suffer from lost character sheets, or it's a hassle to keep the record manually. That's why
            we have built "Tome of Keeping", a web application, which helps 
            players move away from the pain of
            lost adventurers and missing character sheets by giving the user the opportunity
            to create, store, edit, and view their characters here.
            Once a character is created, it can be added to a campaign by a user, alongside
            other characters created by other users.
